remaining columns. \nThis is the instruction on how to calculate an individual carbon footprint for either \na single activity like a hotel_stay or more than one activity.\n If a person from Germany spend one (1) night in a hotel (hotel_stay), the carbon \nfootprint is (1 room-night*13.2 kgCO2e/room-night) = 13.2 kgCO2e. \nTherefore, depending on individual's their carbon footprint can be calculate. \nIf the person is involved in more than one activitity, the sum of their carbon footprint \nwill be calculated.

The \nproduction processes and the rise of fast fashion have taken their toll. Let\u2019s dive into some \npractical tips that will make your journey toward sustainable fashion not only responsible but \nalso inspiring: \n1. Connect with Nature: Choose Fabrics That Honor Our Earth \nWhen it comes to fashion, the choice of fabrics is like selecting the colors of a beautiful painting. \nEmbrace eco-friendly materials that have a story to tell. Consider garments made from organic \ncotton, hemp, or linen. These fabrics are like a gentle breeze whispering tales of sustainability. \nOrganic cotton is grown without harmful pesticides or synthetic fertilizers, nurturing both the \nEarth and the delicate balance of ecosystems. Hemp, a resilient plant, requires less water and \npesticides than traditiona l cotton, making it a sustainable choice. And linen, woven from the \nflax plant, has adorned humanity for centuries, known for its breathability and timeless \nelegance. By choosing these fabrics, you honor our planet and become part of a grand narrative \nof sustainability. \n2. Uncover Hidden Treasures: The Joys of Pre-loved Fashion \nIn a world dominated by fast fashion, let your style be a reflection of your values. Explore the \nwonders of pre-loved fashion, where hidden treasures await. Step into thrift stores, wander \nthrough consignment shops or browse online marketplaces filled with gently worn garments. \nEach piece holds a story, waiting to be rediscovered. \nBy embracing pre-loved fashion, you not only reduce waste but also add depth and character to \nyour wardrobe. Every garment carries a history, a connection to someone else\u2019s journey. And \nas you wear these pieces, you create new chapters, making each outfit a tapestry woven with \nstories. \n3.

Be a Changemaker: Support Ethical Brands \nBehind the scenes, a growing number of fashion brands are working diligently to make a \npositive impact. Seek out those that champion ethical practices, sustainability, and transparency \nin their operations. \nThese brands are the heartbeat of change, using eco-friendly materials and promoting fair trade \nprinciples. They prioritize the welfare of both people and the planet, ensuring safe working \nconditions for their employees. By supporting these visionary brands, you become an advocate \nfor a fashion industry that cares. \n5. Care with Compassion: Nurturing Your Garments \nIn this journey of sustainability, remember to treat your garments with love and compassion. \nFollow the care instructions stitched into each piece, embrace the gentle touch of handwashing, \nand let the breeze embrace your clothes as they air dry. \nBy nurturing your clothing, you embark on a mindful path. You conserve energy, reduce water \nconsumption, and extend the lifespan of your cherished garments. Every stitch and every fabric \nfiber is a testament to your dedication to preserving the beauty of the Earth. \nIn conclusion, the fashion industry\u2019s impact on our environment is undeniable, but we can make \na difference.

Choose organic. \n6. Ditch fast fashion and animal-based textiles. \n7. Be water wise. \n8. Drive less, drive green. \n9. Green your home. \n10. Boycott products that endanger wildlife. \n11. Fight for the right to choose when and if to start a family. \n12. Take action. Use your voice. \n 1. Think twice before shopping. \nEvery product we purchase has an environmental footprint, from the materials used to create it \nto the pollution emitted during manufacturing to the packaging that ends up in landfills and \nincinerators. Even if you can recycle or compost a product at the end of its life, the upstream \ndamage has already been done. So before you buy, ask yourself if you really need it. If you \ndo, consider buying secondhand instead of new, and look for products made from lower-impact \nmaterials and with minimal packaging and shipping.  \n2. Ditch plastic and switch to reuse. \nPlastic never goes away. At least 14 million tons of it ends up in the ocean annually, making up \n80% of all marine debris. Every year thousands of seabirds, sea turtles, seals and other marine \nmammals are killed after ingesting plastic or getting tangled up in it. You can start cutting down \non your plastic waste in a few simple steps: Use reusable bags when you shop, ditch single-use \nwater bottles, bags and straws, and avoid products made from or packaged in plastic whenever \npossible (e.g., select unwrapped produce at the grocery store). Switch from single -use to \nreusable products every chance you get \u2014 every piece of plastic avoided is a win for the planet.  \n3. Take extinction off your plate. \nMeat production is one of the most environmentally destructive industries on the planet, \nresponsible for massive amounts of water use, pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and habitat \ndestruction. So when you choose to eat more plant-based foods and reduce your meat \nconsumption you reduce your environmental footprint. Also, food is the single largest category \nof material thrown into municipal landfills. In the United States nearly 40% of edible food goes \nto waste \u2014 and all of the land, water and other natural resources that went into producing it go \nto waste along with it. Prevent food waste with smart, planned shopping and make sure to \nconsume what you purchase.  \n  \n4. Simplify the holidays. \nHolidays, birthdays, weddings and other celebrations are often excessively wasteful. In \nDecember, for example, Americans create 23% more waste than in other months of the year.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2483, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "deeda6fb-102c-4f4c-80f1-03993e2d84da": {"__data__": {"id_": "deeda6fb-102c-4f4c-80f1-03993e2d84da", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "RAG_file.pdf", "file_path": "/content/RAG_file.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 278290, "creation_date": "2025-04-08", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "97d0b329-9b9d-4a44-916b-99a2fc50ad32", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "RAG_file.pdf", "file_path": "/content/RAG_file.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 278290, "creation_date": "2025-04-08", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-08"}, "hash": "93c351ad2451ab7de40b1f29c09fe3fe4114cd099d42b81d94acbae63e9fc97d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "But it\u2019s not just the extra trash that\u2019s a problem. All the fossil fuels, trees and other natural \nresources that go into producing gifts, decorations, single -use dinnerware and wrapping paper \nmake our celebrations dreary for wildlife and the habitat they need to survive. But you can \nredefine your celebrations in ways that respect land, waters and wildlife. Instead of celebrating \nyour next holiday with plastic d\u00e9cor, excessive gifts and single-use food and drink containers, \nyou can decorate with foraged plan ts, give homemade or secondhand gifts, and serve plant -\nbased meals with reusable dinnerware.  \n5. Choose organic. \nFrom coffee to fruit to clothing, choosing organic products helps reduce your impact on wildlife \nand the planet. More than 2 billion pounds of pesticides are sold annually in the United States. \nPesticides are pervasive in fish and wildlife habitat and threaten the survival and recovery of \nhundreds of federally listed species. Pesticides also pollute the air, water and soil and \ncontaminate the food we eat. If you garden, avoid pesticides at home by growing organically. \nBuilding wildlife habitat in your yard by growing native, pollinator -friendly plants and \nremoving invasive species will attract beneficial insects and help keep unwanted pests away. \nWhen you choose organic, you\u2019re keeping harmful pesticides out of our land and water, \nprotecting farm workers, vulnerable communities, wildlife and your family. \n6. Ditch fast fashion and animal-based textiles. \nFast fashion is an enormous, rapidly growing industry. The number of new garments made per \nyear has nearly doubled over the past 20 years, and our global consumption of fashion has \nincreased by 400%. The fast fashion industry is a significant contributor to the climate crisis, \nresponsible for as much as 10% of global carbon emissions. Animal -based textiles like wool \nare responsible for water pollution, widespread habitat loss from deforestation, and other harms \nto wildlife. Slow down your fashion by caring for your clothes, repairing when possible and, \nwhen you need new clothes, shop secondhand or join clothing swaps. If you must buy new, \nlook past the greenwashing and purchase clothing made of truly sustainable materials like \norganic cotton or Tencel from brands that are made to last. \n7. Be water wise. \nWater conservation is critical as our growing population puts increased demand on the nation\u2019s \nwater sources and we face unprecedented droughts. You can conserve water by taking shorter \nshowers, fixing leaky toilets, and choosing low-flow and low-water appliance options. Consider \nxeriscaping your yard, a landscaping technique that uses native, drought -adapted plants that \nrequire less water and maintenance over time and provide habitat and food for birds and bees. \nAlso, one of the biggest water hogs is animal agriculture, so shifting your diet away from meat \nand dairy products saves water too. \n8. Drive less, drive green. \nFossil-fueled transportation emissions create greenhouse gases, smog, soot and other harmful \nair pollution. But changing your driving habits can dramatically reduce your carbon footprint. \nWalk, bike, carpool, use public transportation or join ride or bike shares whenever possible. \nCombine errands to make fewer trips. Participate in, or start, car-free days in your community.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3355, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "718151f9-b4b2-473e-b356-9f0af51a1a2c": {"__data__": {"id_": "718151f9-b4b2-473e-b356-9f0af51a1a2c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "RAG_file.pdf", "file_path": "/content/RAG_file.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 278290, "creation_date": "2025-04-08", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f3ad1663-57f0-4468-9b22-cf5626bd0558", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "RAG_file.pdf", "file_path": "/content/RAG_file.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 278290, "creation_date": "2025-04-08", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-08"}, "hash": "9c8c1d6c11769d978f21f176aca04a5e4cdad32589caff1daa439271537d0765", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Ask your local officials to invest in electric vehicle fleets and charging stations, and if you\u2019re \nin the market for a new car, consider buying electric.

Tune-ups can increase your fuel efficiency \u2014 a \ntire that is 20% underinflated can increase a vehicle\u2019s fuel consumption by 10%.  \n9. Green your home. \nJust as keeping your car in shape improves your fuel efficiency, keeping your home in shape \nimproves your energy efficiency. Make sure your home has adequate insulation and energy-\nsaving windows and use a programmable thermostat for more efficient heating and cooling \u2014 \nand, of course, energy-saving lightbulbs for more efficient lighting. If your state allows you to \npick your electricity supplier, use a company that generates at least half of its power from wind, \nsolar and other clean sources. Installing rooftop solar panels or solar water heating also helps \nthe planet and can save you money. Many states now offer incentives to help you green your \nhome or rental at low or no cost. Call your energy provider to see if it offers free energy audits \nor knows of a company that does. \n \n10. Boycott products that endanger wildlife. \nProducts made from animals on the endangered species list are illegal to buy, sell, import or \ntrade in the United States, but if a plant or animal hasn\u2019t been listed yet, they can still be harmed \nfor someone\u2019s profit. Also, some products harm endangered species by threatening their habitat, \nfrom cutting down old-growth forests to using up the water that riparian species need to survive. \nTo avoid contributing to the endangerment of wildlife, shop conscientiously and look for \nproducts made from sustainable materials like bamboo and dine at restaurants that refuse to \nserve imperiled species like bluefin tuna. \n \n11. Fight for the right to choose when and if to start a family. \nWith more than 8 billion people in the world our demands for food, water, land and fossil fuels \nare pushing other species to extinction. Human population growth and consumption are at the \nroot of our most pressing environmental crises, but they\u2019re often left out of the conversation. \nBy advancing reproductive health, rights and justice and gender equity, we can improve the \nhealth of people and the planet because better education and access to family-planning services \ndecreases family size and our overall carbon footprint. Get the conversation started by talking \nabout family planning with your partner. In your community, stand up for reproductive freedom \nby supporting comprehensive sex ed in schools, free and easily accessible contraception and \nabortion access.  \n12. Take action.

A circular economy where there is no waste and \nwhere all material outputs become inputs is well beyond our technological and organizational \ncapacity today. But that does not mean we shouldn\u2019t think about how to get from here to there. \nMuch of the work in building environmental sustainability requires the development of systems \nthat enable us to live our lives as we wish while damaging the planet as little as possible. Large-\nscale institutions are needed to manage sewage treatment and drinking water, to develop \nrenewable energy and build a modern energy grid. Government policy is needed to ensure the \nconservation of forests, oceans, and biodiversity. Pandemic avoidance requires global, national \nand local systems of public health. Climate change mitigation and adaptation also r equire \ncollective action. What then can individuals do? \nAs individuals, we make choices about our own activities and inevitably, they involve choices \nabout resource consumption. I see little value in criticizing people who fly on airplanes to travel \nto global climate conferences. (I assume you do remember airplanes and conferences, don\u2019t \nyou?) But I see great value in considering the importance of your attendance at the conference \nand asking if the trip is an indulgence or if you will have an important opportunity to learn and \nteach. This year has taught us how to attend events virtually. There is little question that live \npresence at an event enables a type of communication that can\u2019t be achieved virtually. Many \ntimes, you will judge that the financial and environmental cost of the trip is far outweighed by \nthe benefits. Those are the times you should travel. My argument here is that it is the thought \nprocess, the analysis of environmental costs and benefits, that is at the heart of an individual\u2019s \nresponsibility for environmental sustainability. Individuals are responsible for thinking about \ntheir impact on the environment and, when possible, minimize the damage they do to the planet. \nEveryone needs to turn on the lights at night, start the shower in the morning, turn on the air \nconditioning and possibly drive somewhere on Mother\u2019s Day. I would never argue that you \nshould give up these forms of consumption. Instead, I believe we should all pay attention to the \nresources we use and the impact it has. We are responsible for that thought process and the \nrelated analysis of how we, as individuals, might accomplish the same ends with less \nenvironmentally damaging means. \nSome say that the fixation on individual responsibility is a distraction from the more important \ntask of compelling government and major institutions to implement systemic change. This \nperspective was forcefully argued in 2019 in The Guardian by Professor Anders Levermann of \nthe Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. According to Professor Levermann: \n\u201cPersonal sacrifice alone cannot be the solution to tackling the climate crisis. There\u2019s no other \narea in which the individual is held so responsible for what\u2019s going wrong. And it\u2019s true: people \ndrive too much, eat too much meat, and fly too often. But reaching zero emissions requires very \nfundamental changes. Individual sacrifice alone will not bring us to zero. It can be achieved \nonly by real structural change; by a new industrial revolution.

It suggests that all \nwe have to do is pull ourselves together over the next 30 years and save energy, walk, skip \nholidays abroad, and simply \u2018do without.\u2019 But these demands for individual action paralyse \npeople, thereby preventing the large-scale change we so urgently need.\u201d \nPerhaps, but I do not see it that way. I consider individual responsibility and the thought process \nand value shift that stimulates individual action as the foundation of the social learning process \nrequired for effective collective action. In other words, individual change and collective system-\nlevel change are interconnected. The fact is that on a planet of nearly 8 billion people, it is too \nlate for many of us to get back to the land and live as one with nature. There\u2019s too many of us \nand not enough nature. There is an absolute limit to our ability as individuals to reduce our \nimpact on the planet. Therefore, system-level change is absolutely needed. But system change \nrequires individuals to understand the need for change along with a well-understood definition \nof the problem. The cognitive dissonance of identifying a problem but never acting on it is \ndifficult to live with. If you see a poor child on the street begging for food, you can provide that \nchild with food and money while continuing to support public policy that addresses the child \npoverty issue at the systems level. In fact, the emotional impact of that child\u2019s face may well \nprovide the drive that leads you to fight harder for the policy that would prevent that child from \nneeding to beg. We learn by example, and vivid experiences and cases can lead to \ntransformative systemic change. \nWhile I consider individual and collective responsibility connected, without collective systems \nand infrastructure supporting environmental sustainability, there are distinct limits to what \nindividual action can achieve. That is why I see no value in shaming individuals for consuming \nfossil fuels, eating meat, or buying a child a Mylar birthday balloon. I believe an attitude of \nmoral superiority is particularly destructive in any effort to build the political support needed \nfor systemic change. \nAs my mentor, the late Professor Lester Milbrath, often argued, the only way to save the planet \nis through social learning that would enable us to \u201clearn our way to a sustainable society.\u201d He \nmade this argument in his pathbreaking work: Envisioning a Sustainable Society: Learning Our \nWay Out. In Milbrath\u2019s view, the key was to understand environmental perceptions and values \nand to build on those values and perceptions to change both individual behavior and the \ninstitutions their politics generated. To Milbr ath, the human effort to dominate nature had \nworked too well, and a new approach was needed. As he observed in Envisioning a Sustainable \nSociety: \n\u201cLearning how to reason together about values is crucial to saving our species. As a society we \nhave to learn better how to learn, I call it social learning; it is the dynamic for change that could \nlead us to a new kind of society that will not destroy itself from its own excess.\u201d \nMy view is that one method to pursue social learning is learning by doing \u2014 in other words by \nencouraging the individual behaviors we might each take to reduce our environmental impact. \nThose behaviors remind us to think about the planet\u2019s wellbeing along with our own.

How much does it actually matter? \nStudents from Charles University in Prague who participated in the HBS study trip on \u201cFeminist \nand Climate Foreign Policy\u201d in Berlin write about why it is important not to blame the climate \ncrisis on individuals and their consumer choices \nIn a world grappling with the urgent need to combat the climate crisis, the concept of the \nindividual carbon footprint has gained significant attention. We are constantly bombarded with \nmessages about reducing our personal carbon emissions, from driving electric cars to cutting \nback on meat consumption. How much does our individual carbon footprint really matter in the \ngrand scheme of things, though? \nThe idea behind measuring individual carbon footprints is to hold each person accountable for \ntheir contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. It aims to encourage individuals to adopt more \nsustainable lifestyles and make environmentally conscious choices. However, the majority of \nglobal greenhouse gas emissions are not generated by individuals, but rather by industries and \nlarge-scale commercial activities. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \n(IPCC), around 70% of carbon dioxide emissions stem from just 100 companies worldwide. \nThis staggering statistic highlights that individual efforts alone cannot single-handedly solve \nthe climate crisis. Our personal choices do have an impact, albeit on a smaller scale. When \nindividuals collectively adopt sustainable practices, it can create a ripple effect, influencing \nlarger entities and prompting policy changes. \nIt is crucial to strike a balance between individual action and systemic change. While \nindividuals should certainly strive to reduce their carbon footprints, it is equally important to \naddress the systemic issues that contribute to climate crisis. Governme nts, corporations, and \ninstitutions must play their part by implementing policies that promote renewable energy, invest \nin sustainable infrastructure, and regulate emissions from major industries. Moreover, focusing \nsolely on individual carbon footprints can lead to a sense of guilt and overwhelm, causing \npeople to feel that their efforts are futile. Combating the climate crisis nevertheless requires \ncollective action and systemic change. Individuals can support larger movements, engage in \nactivism, advocate for policies that promote a low -carbon future and even strive to keep their \nown carbon footprint low. However, it is exactly the overestimation of the individual impact on \nthe climate crisis that can lead to climate anxiety, especially among youngsters.

Nevertheless, we still see that around 100 companies are responsible for \napproximately 71 % of CO2 emissions globally. How do you perceive these numbers? \nA: The generally-known fact regarding the popularization of the idea of a carbon footprint still \nhas to be stated over and over:  It started as an advertising campaign of BP, the British oil and \ngas company, and it is being used to this day to shift the blame away from fossil fuel companies \nand onto common people. \nLeaving responsibility for the necessary change to the companies and fossil fuel industries in \nthe hope that they will act with the environment in mind is naive, and political and societal \nchanges have to be put into place to counteract this. Climate justice will not be achieved when \nthousands are literally dying from climate change-related catastrophes around the world while \nfossil fuel companies are banking record profits. \nThis is not to say that individual action does not have its value, though.

Therefore, climate policies should also \ninclude support to these individuals so that we do not increase inequality and therefore \ndemobilization, since some services and products are sure to increase in price due to higher \ntaxes or reduced state subsidies. \nEven if we change our rhetoric from \u201cclimate catastrophe\u201d to \u201cclimate opportunity\u201d, climate \nanxiety will still be present, which involves a wider, different political debate about the need \nfor increased availability of mental health support facilities, mainly for the younger generation.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3197, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a8437038-ebcd-4e1e-9b18-5dddff6372d4": {"__data__": {"id_": "a8437038-ebcd-4e1e-9b18-5dddff6372d4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "RAG_file.pdf", "file_path": "/content/RAG_file.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 278290, "creation_date": "2025-04-08", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f9dc87a6-328c-42b2-956c-f46906b298cb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "RAG_file.pdf", "file_path": "/content/RAG_file.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 278290, "creation_date": "2025-04-08", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-08"}, "hash": "fcdf25f64bbf3254cfa034dd1562cc69bd6256a921d5bc03a7598f667355f628", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "As we can see, the carbon footprints of individuals do play a role, but their impact is limited \ncompared to industrial emissions.

The study\u2019s goal \nwas to identify which incentives could promote household action to help shape policy \nrecommendations. \nWe shared a few of the Klima community\u2019s questions, asked her how individuals can help in \nthe fight against climate change, and got a few insider tips on how to green up our own lives. \nDo my choices at home really contribute to climate change?  \nYes, absolutely. A 2009 study linked 72% of greenhouse gas emissions to household \nconsumption. You see, the private consumption-dimension is hardly targeted by today's climate \npolicies \u2014 which is problematic given how large a share of global emissions can be linked to \nhousehold consumption activities. \nWe should really start paying closer attention to consumption- related emissions \u2014 like those \ndirectly and indirectly related to our diets, mobility choices, and the goods and services we all \nbuy. From this broader perspective, it's clear that the individual choices we make as consumers \n(and the consumption activities we engage in) can play a significant role in curbing global \nemissions. \nMy partner thinks that adopting a sustainable lifestyle is expensive.

Living a sustainable lifestyle simply means consuming less \u2014 and therefore spending \nless! \nBeside switching to renewable energy and saving electricity at home, what else can I do to \nreduce my household\u2019s carbon footprint? \nThe most impactful actions you can take are reducing air travel and private car use, as well as \ncutting animal products in your diet. Picking public transport instead of a private car (or even \nbetter, walking or cycling), reducing food waste, as well as buying less food that travelled long \ndistances in a frozen state, are all very effective ways to reduce your daily CO2e emissions. \nCan you tell us some facts that really surprised you during your research on household \nconsumption? \nIt was interesting to see how many people underestimated the climate impact of day -to-day \nbehaviors. Some were genuinely convinced recycling was the most they could do to help the \nplanet, and were amazed to find out they could achieve so much more with relatively little \neffort. \nSix months after taking part in the HOPE simulation of reducing household emissions through \ndifferent types of consumption changes, we talked to a smaller group of the simulation \nparticipants. Many said they became more aware of their personal impact on the climate, and \nhad rethought some of their consumption activities because of it. \nAnother interesting learning was how many of the people we talked to six months after the \nHOPE simulation described a low-carbon future as something really positive. Many thought of \nit as a better way of life, not just at the climate level, but also from a  health and social point of \nview. \nDo you have any tips for being greener while working from home? \nI haven\u2019t done any scientific work on this topic, but I can share some personal reflections based \non what I know about energy, food, and transport -related emissions. Working from home \ncompared to commuting to work by car or public transport and working in an office building \nrequiring energy for heating or cooling, and other things, is likely more climate -friendly if it \nreduces the amount of energy used for offices and transport. \nHowever, it also depends of course on how much we change our energy consumption (related \nto heating and such) at home when spending more time there. That's important to remember. \nWorking from home might also be an opportunity to introduce new good habits t o our daily \nroutines, like reducing food waste by utilizing leftovers for lunch and making sure to switch off \nour electronic devices when no longer using them. \nI would love my office to become more sustainable but my employer doesn\u2019t seem to be \ninterested \u2014 what could I do to try and convince them?  \nAlthough I\u2019m not an expert in this topic, here are a few personal tips.

We'll then use strategic climate games in local processes for policy \ndevelopment and sustainability planning, with the aim of arriving at strategies and policies that \nare compatible with the local climate budgets. \n \nThe four lifestyle choices that most reduce your carbon footprint \nA new study has identified the four actions that would have the greatest impact on an \nindividual\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions: eating a plant-based diet, avoiding air travel, living car \nfree, and having fewer children. \nThe comprehensive study analysed 39 peer -reviewed articles, carbon calculators and \ngovernment sources to quantify the most high- impact personal lifestyle choices in developed \ncountries. \n\u201cThere are so many factors that affect the climate impact of personal choices, but bringing all \nthese studies side -by-side gives us confidence we\u2019ve identified actions that make a big \ndifference. Those of us who want to step forward on climate need to know how our actions can \nhave the greatest possible impact. This research is about helping people make more informed \nchoices,\u201d says lead author Seth Wynes. \nThe study found that, on average, eating a plant -based diet saves about 0.8 tonnes CO2-\nequivalents per year. Each roundtrip transatlantic flight avoided saves 1.6 tonnes, and living \ncar-free for a year saves 2.4 tonnes. \nTo put this in context, per capita carbon dioxide emissions should not exceed 2.1 tonnes \nannually by the year 2050 - if the goal of limiting the global temperature increase to well below \ntwo degrees Celsius is to be achieved. \nFamily size also mattered: when accounting for the impact of future descendants at current \nemission rates, having one fewer child would save 58.6 tonnes per year.
